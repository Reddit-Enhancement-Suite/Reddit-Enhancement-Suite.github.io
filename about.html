		<h3>Steve Sobel (honestbleeps)</h3>
		<p>Reddit Enhancement Suite is primarily the work of Steve Sobel.  Steve spends a considerable amount of time each week on user support and programming, and is always thinking up new ideas for RES.</p>
		<p>For more than a decade, Steve has been working in the world of web development. His skills span back end technologies from PHP/MySQL and ASP/MSSQL to other languages like Python.  In addition, he is experienced with numerous front end technologies like javascript, HTML and CSS. He is the current director of technology at <a href="http://www.15letters.com/" target="_blank">15 Letters</a>.</p>
		<p>Why this project? Why RES? Because he loves reddit and loves user experience improvement. RES is as much for himself as it is for the hundreds of thousands of users benefitting from it. He personally reads and considers every single suggestion RES users offer on how to make the product better.</p>
		<p>On the personal side of things, Steve is a Chicago native that loves the Blackhawks, poker, and live music amongst other hobbies.<br>
